    <p>Alternative documentation system for Adobe ExtendScript API</p>

<section><p>We at Yearbook Machine make extensive use of the ExtendScript API on a
daily basis, but found the documentation system difficult to deal with.
This is our solution to the problem. An attempt at making the ExtendScript
API documentation more accessible and easier to use than the native Object
Model Viewer.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="http://yearbookmachine.github.io/esdocs">browse the documentation online</a>,
<a href="http://yearbookmachine.github.io/esdocs/ybm-esapi-docs.zip">download a copy</a> to host yourself,
or even help us out over on <a href="https://github.com/yearbookmachine/extendscript-api-documentation">GitHub</a>.</p>

It can do so incrementally, periodically notifying Adobe Bridge of the current status. For this object, the start() method should spawn a thread to perform the operation and return immediately. Adobe Bridge displays a Progress bar, and resumes activity on the main thread. When the background thread updates the status in any way that affects the display, it must pass this object to  app.operationChanged(). Adobe Bridge queries this object in order to update the Progress dialog or display the Adobe Bridge-supplied error handling or resolution conflict dialogs."

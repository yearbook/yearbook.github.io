It creates the ExtensionModel object using the handler\u2019s makeModel() method, and stores it in the CacheElement. It then passes the CacheElement object to the node handler\u2019s model method registerInterest().Your implementation of the registerInterest() method must store the cache object (typically in the model object's privateData property) so that the model\u2019s refreshInfoset() method can use it to update the data.

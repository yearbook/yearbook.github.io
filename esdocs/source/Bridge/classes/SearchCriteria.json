This object specifies the left and right sides. By default, all of the predefined operators are displayed for user selection. You can use this object to limit which of these operators are available for selection. \nThe user's choices in the dialog are returned to Adobe Bridge in a set of a SearchCondition objects contained in a SearchSpecification object.

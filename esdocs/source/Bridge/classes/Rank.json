Adobe Bridge sorts result nodes by the value of the chosen rank property, and returns no more than the maximum number of result nodes with the highest rank values. When the result is displayed, the view sorts the nodes again using its sorting criteria.The attribute name and display name of a property used for ranking are encapsulated in a Rank object.An array of these objects kept in SearchDefinition.ranks. They are used to populate the Rank field that corresponds to the definition in the Find dialog. If there is more than one, the field displays a drop-down list. The rank that the user selects becomes the SearchSpecification.rankField value."
